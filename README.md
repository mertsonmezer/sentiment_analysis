# Sentiment Analysis

This is a project that can predict whether a person's comment is positive or not. A basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is going to be used for this job. During the project, we will use the IMDB dataset, which includes user comments and labels. You can get the dataset from Keras easily. The main purpose of this project is to classify the comments for a specific issue. For instance, a business might introduce a product and then gather and classify customers' opinions to develop it using this project.

## Context
* Importing the Required Libraries and Dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Preprocessing the Dataset
* Contructing the RNN Model
* Training the RNN Model
* Results

To examine the code and for more information, you can look at the file of "sentiment_analysis.ipynb".
